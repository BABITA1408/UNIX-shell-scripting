Since the invention of computers or machines, their capability to perform various tasks went
on growing exponentially. Humans have developed the power of computer systems in terms
of their diverse working domains, their increasing speed, and reducing size with respect to
time.
A branch of Computer Science named Artificial Intelligence pursues creating the computers or
machines as intelligent as human beings.
What is Artificial Intelligence?
According to the father of Artificial Intelligence John McCarthy, it is “The science and
engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”.
Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a
software think intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think.
AI is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and
work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of
developing intelligent software and systems.
Philosophy of AI
While exploiting the power of the computer systems, the curiosity of human, lead him to
wonder, “Can a machine think and behave like humans do?”
Thus, the development of AI started with the intention of creating similar intelligence in
machines that we find and regard high in humans.
Goals of AI
 To Create Expert Systems: The systems which exhibit intelligent behavior, learn,
demonstrate, explain, and advice its users.
 To Implement Human Intelligence in Machines: Creating systems that
understand, think, learn, and behave like humans.

What Contributes to AI?
Artificial intelligence is a science and technology based on disciplines such as Computer
Science, Biology, Psychology, Linguistics, Mathematics, and Engineering. A major thrust of AI
is in the development of computer functions associated with human intelligence, such as
reasoning, learning, and problem solving.
