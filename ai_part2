AI has been dominant in various fields such as:
 Gaming
AI plays crucial role in strategic games such as chess, poker, tic-tac-toe, etc., where
machine can think of large number of possible positions based on heuristic knowledge.
 Natural Language Processing
It is possible to interact with the computer that understands natural language spoken
by humans.
 Expert Systems
There are some applications which integrate machine, software, and special
information to impart reasoning and advising. They provide explanation and advice to
the users.
 Vision Systems
These systems understand, interpret, and comprehend visual input on the computer.
For example,
